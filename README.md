# React-native with MSW, Jest, React Query and React Testing Library

## Description

This is a simple project template to demonstrate how to use MSW with React Native. It uses Jest and React Testing Library to test the application.

This application also has @tanstack/react-query to show how to use MSW with react-query for async state management and how I would typically test this in my application, including testing the rendering logic as well as isolating the `useQuery` or `useMutation` hooks in a test.

3. Run `yarn start`
